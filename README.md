### Inspiration

The topic is "boring made less boring", right? What comes to mind when you hear boring? Well, if you're a student, obviously, homework! Sometimes it's so boring, I forget to do it, I dread it so much. That's why we made __Track-It__: a gamified version of homework, by students, for students!

### What it does
The app starts off as a to-do list. In the add assignment dialogue, users can type the name of the assignment, and use the dropdowns to specify which type of assignment it is and which class it's for. When you mark it as complete, you get a certain amount of points, depending on the assignment. You also have an option to remove it from your catalog. 

Now the fun part begins. Once you accumulate points, you can gamble them with the opportunity to gain more, as well as the risk to lose them. The user has different options to gamble based on a variety of risk factors, and the choice of how many points they wish to put on the table. Another fun part of the app is that there is a rock-paper-scissors game which the user can play against the computer. For each round win, the user can gain 10 points, as well as lose 10 points with a loss. A draw has no impact on points. The matchup is also displayed with icons of the user's and computer's respective choices. There is an option at the bottom of the screen to return to the home page, where the user can continue to add assignments, gamble for points, and enjoy their new fun endeavor of homework completion.

### How we built it

We built this web app on replit. We built it using HTML and CSS for the front-end displays and UI, and JavaScript for the back end functions, such as those for assignment cards, gambling, and rock-paper-scissors. 

### Challenges we ran into

Some challenges we ran into included the structuring of the site, primarily using HTML to organize our components in a way where it doesn't look like a buggy web app. This took a while because the resources that we used to debug this did not provide any valuable assistance with this. We eventually accomplished it by completely refactoring our HTML code into different components, simplifying the process.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of

Something we're proud of is building a functional app that we will probably use in school life until we graduate, and made in only 2 days! We're also proud of the amazing-looking CSS and functional Javascript code.

### What we learned

We learned more about CSS animations and about saving data in Javascript, to create a basic backend using localStorage.
